* [100 Laps is a challenging, top-down arcade racing game where the primary objective is to survive and complete 100 laps. To play, use the WASD or Arrow Keys to accelerate, brake, and steer your vehicle down a busy four-lane road, dodging numerous AI cars. Colliding with other cars or the side walls will decrease your "Life" percentage, and the game ends if your life drops to zero. A unique mechanic is the police: driving at a high speed (over 350) will attract a police car that spawns to chase you. If this police car catches you, your run is over. The game tracks your laps, time, and crash count, saving your best results to a local high-score list.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/100laps.html)

* [Adventure is a 2D survival RPG where the ultimate goal is to fight your way through 20 levels, find the key, unlock the door, and defeat the final boss to rescue a captive Unicorn. Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move and the mouse to interact. Click on resources like trees and rocks to gather them, which costs health but provides materials for crafting. You can craft items using hotkeys like 'B' for a shelter, 'C' for a crossbow, and 'V' or 'H' for stone weapons. Combat is initiated by clicking on monsters for melee attacks or right-clicking to shoot a ranged weapon. Be wary of the day/night cycle; monsters grow stronger at night, and ghosts will appear to steal your items if you're caught outside a shelter. You can interact with NPCs using the 'E' key, switch weapons with the number keys, and save your progress at any time using the save icon.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/adventure.html)
