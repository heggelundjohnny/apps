### Games
* [**100 Laps** is a challenging, top-down arcade racing game where the primary objective is to survive and complete 100 laps. To play, use the WASD or Arrow Keys to accelerate, brake, and steer your vehicle down a busy four-lane road, dodging numerous AI cars. Colliding with other cars or the side walls will decrease your "Life" percentage, and the game ends if your life drops to zero. A unique mechanic is the police: driving at a high speed (over 350) will attract a police car that spawns to chase you. If this police car catches you, your run is over. The game tracks your laps, time, and crash count, saving your best results to a local high-score list.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/100laps.html)

* [**Adventure** is a 2D survival RPG where the ultimate goal is to fight your way through 20 levels, find the key, unlock the door, and defeat the final boss to rescue a captive Unicorn. Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move and the mouse to interact. Click on resources like trees and rocks to gather them, which costs health but provides materials for crafting. You can craft items using hotkeys like 'B' for a shelter, 'C' for a crossbow, and 'V' or 'H' for stone weapons. Combat is initiated by clicking on monsters for melee attacks or right-clicking to shoot a ranged weapon. Be wary of the day/night cycle; monsters grow stronger at night, and ghosts will appear to steal your items if you're caught outside a shelter. You can interact with NPCs using the 'E' key, switch weapons with the number keys, and save your progress at any time using the save icon.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/adventure.html)

* [**Lander Rescue** is a physics-based browser game where you pilot a lunar lander through 50 challenging levels. The objective is to use the ARROW KEYS for rotation and thrust to safely navigate hazardous terrain while avoiding enemy fire. Your mission involves a multi-step rescue operation: land on the blue pads to pick up stranded people, visit yellow pads to refuel your ship, and finally, land on the green pads to drop off your passengers, score points, and advance to the next level. Success depends on careful fuel management and executing gentle landings within safe velocity limits to avoid crashing.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/lunarlander.html)

* [**Sokoban** is a top-down puzzle game where you control a character (@), the "warehouse keeper," inside a maze-like level. The goal is to push all the boxes ($) onto designated target squares(.). The rules are simple but create a deep challenge: you can only push boxes (never pull them), and you can only push one box at aime. You can't push a box if there's a wall (#) or another box directly behind it. The game is all about spatial reasoning and planning, as you must figure out the correct sequence of moves to get every box to its destination without getting any of them stuck in a corner or against a wall where you can no longer move them.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/sokoban.html)
### Tools
* [**video** player built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed for a rich media playback experience. It seamlessly plays local video files (MP4, WebM) and external SRT subtitles, which can be loaded via drag-and-drop, pasting from the clipboard, or a standard file-open button. Its power lies in its advanced controls: you can set precise A-B loops and even record that loop directly to a new WebM file. The player also features frame-by-frame stepping and frame capture (saving as a PNG). Subtitle management is robust, offering on-the-fly timing offset adjustments, font size controls, and a filter to hide SDH descriptions (e.g., "sighs"). For audio, it includes a volume booster (up to 400%) using the Web Audio API. To enhance usability, it automatically saves your playback position for each video locally and provides a handy help modal documenting all keyboard shortcuts.](https://johnny-heggelund.github.io/videoplayer.html)
