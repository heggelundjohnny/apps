<h2>Games Online</h2>

<h3>🚔 <a href="100laps.html">100 Laps</a></h3>
<p>A challenging, top-down arcade racing game where the primary objective is to survive and complete 100 laps.
To play, use the WASD or Arrow Keys to accelerate, brake, and steer your vehicle down a busy four-lane road,
dodging numerous AI cars. Colliding with other cars or the side walls will decrease your "Life" percentage,
and the game ends if your life drops to zero. A unique mechanic is the police: driving at a high speed (over 350)
will attract a police car that spawns to chase you. If this police car catches you, your run is over. The game
tracks your laps, time, and crash count, saving your best results to a local high-score list.</p>

<h3>🔑 <a href="adventure.html">Adventure</a></h3>
<p>This is a 2D survival adventure RPG where the ultimate goal is to fight your way through 20 levels, find the key,
unlock the door, and defeat the final boss to rescue a captive Unicorn. Use the WASD or Arrow keys to move and the
mouse to interact. Click on resources like trees and rocks to gather them, which costs health but provides materials
for crafting. You can craft items using hotkeys like 'B' for a shelter, 'C' for a crossbow, and 'V' or 'H' for stone
weapons. Combat is initiated by clicking on monsters for melee attacks or right-clicking to shoot a ranged weapon.
Be wary of the day/night cycle; monsters grow stronger at night, and ghosts will appear to steal your items if you're
caught outside a shelter. You can interact with NPCs using the 'E' key, switch weapons with the number keys, and save
your progress at any time using the save icon.</p>

<h3>💮 <a href="ameliax.html">Amelia X</a></h3>
<p>Endless runner game where you control a character escaping a corrupt data network after stealing a data core.
The objective is to survive as long as possible to achieve a high score. You control the character using the Spacebar
or Up Arrow to jump, and the height of the jump is determined by how long you hold the key. You must avoid two main threats:
falling into gaps in the terrain and colliding with magenta antivirus drones, which drain 5% of your power per hit. The game
ends if you fall into the void or your power level drops to zero, at which point your score is recorded and your top three
high scores are saved.</p>

<h3>🎱 <a href="billiards.html">Billiards</a></h3>
<p>This online billiards game is a simulation where your objective is to be the first player to pocket all of your assigned
balls (either solids or stripes) and then legally pocket the 8-ball to win. To play, you use your mouse to drag on the table,
which both aims your shot and sets the power; the farther you drag, the harder the shot will be. The game assists you by
showing a white dashed line for the cue ball's path and a yellow line for the object ball's predicted direction. You release
the mouse button to take the shot. The table is open until the first ball is pocketed, which assigns that ball's group
(solids or stripes) to the player who made the shot, and your turn continues as long as you legally pocket your own balls.</p>

<h3>💸 <a href="blackjack.html">Blackjack</a></h3>
<p>You start with 1,000 chips, and your objective is to reach the goal of 100,000 chips. To play, you begin a round by
selecting a bet amount (10, 50, 100, 200, or 500 chips) from the available buttons. The goal of Blackjack is to get a hand
value closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. You and the dealer will both be dealt two cards, but one of the
dealer's cards will remain hidden. On your turn, you can Hit to take another card or Stand to keep your current hand and
end your turn. If your hand's value exceeds 21, you bust and immediately lose your bet. After you stand, the dealer reveals
their hidden card and must continue to hit until their hand totals 17 or more. You win if your score is higher than the
dealer's or if the dealer busts; a normal win pays 2:1 (doubling your bet), and a "Blackjack" (a 21 on the first two cards)
pays 2.5:1. The game ends if you run out of chips or if you successfully reach the 100,000 chip goal.</p>

<h3>🚘 <a href="championship.html">Championship</a></h3>
<p>In this online game, your goal is to compete in a 10-race championship against 9 AI opponents and get the highest score.
You control your car using W to accelerate, S to brake or reverse, and A/D to steer. The key mechanic is drifting, which you
can do by holding the Spacebar while turning to charge up your boost meter. When the meter is full, press Shift to use a
powerful speed boost. On the track, you can pick up lightning bolts for an instant boost and must avoid oil slicks that make
you spin out. Be careful, as driving on the grass will slow you down. You can also press P to pause the game.</p>

<h3>🏠 <a href="citybuilder.html">City Builder</a></h3>
<p>Welcome, Mayor! In this city-builder game, your primary goal is to grow your small town into a thriving metropolis
by reaching a population of 80,000 residents. To play, you use the construction tools to place buildings like houses,
stores, roads, and power plants onto the map grid, all of which cost money from your budget. You must carefully manage
your finances, as your city earns income from taxes but must also pay for the annual maintenance of every building you place.
To grow your population, you must provide electricity to your buildings by connecting them to power plants via power lines
or other adjacent buildings, and you can boost growth by placing services like parks, schools, and fire stations.
Be careful, if your budget drops below zero, you'll go bankrupt and the game will be over, so you must also prepare for
random disasters like fires, economic recessions, or even a King Kong attack.</p>

<h3>🏬 <a href="citybuilder2.html">City Builder 2 (Beta Test Version)</a></h3>
<p>In this city-building simulation, your main objective is to grow a thriving metropolis to a population of 400,000
residents while avoiding bankruptcy. To play, you select construction tools from the UI panel to click and build zones—like
houses, stores, and industry—directly onto the map. You must also build essential infrastructure, such as roads to connect
your zones and power plants with power lines to provide electricity. You'll manage your city's economy by setting the tax rate,
balancing the income from citizens and businesses against the annual maintenance costs for your buildings. Be sure to provide
services like police, fire stations, and schools to boost growth, all while managing challenges like industrial pollution
and random disasters such as fires, recessions, or even King Kong.</p>

<h3>🚀 <a href="lunarlander.html">Lander Rescue</a></h3>
<p>Physics-based browser game where you pilot a lunar lander through 50 challenging levels. The objective is to use
the Arrow Keys for rotation and thrust to safely navigate hazardous terrain while avoiding enemy fire. Your mission
involves a multi-step rescue operation: land on the blue pads to pick up stranded people, visit yellow pads to refuel
your ship, and finally, land on the green pads to drop off your passengers, score points, and advance to the next
level. Success depends on careful fuel management and executing gentle landings within safe velocity limits to
avoid crashing.</p>

<h3>🟢 <a href="ludo.html">Ludo Board Game</a></h3>
<p>4-player Ludo game where you take control of the Green player, while the Blue, Red, and Yellow players are all
controlled by an AI. To play, click the "Roll the dice" button to start your turn. The game will automatically calculate
all possible moves and highlight your movable pawns with a glowing animation; you then click on the glowing pawn you wish
to move. The game follows standard Ludo rules, including requiring a 6 to move out of the home yard, knocking opponent
pawns back to start on landing, and winning by getting all four pawns into the final home stretch. For a demonstration,
you can also click the Autopilot button, which will have the AI take over the Green player's turns as well, allowing you
to watch a full AI-vs-AI simulation.</p>

<h3>⛳ <a href="minigolf.html">Mini Golf</a></h3>
<p>This is a 10-hole mini-golf game where you compete against an AI opponent to finish the course with the fewest total
strokes. You control the cyan ball, while the AI controls the yellow one. To take your turn, click and drag from your ball
to aim and set the power, and then release the mouse to shoot. You must navigate around obstacles and a wandering turtle.
Be careful, as hitting the turtle causes you to forfeit the hole with a penalty. The player with the lowest total score
after 10 holes wins the game.</p>

<h3>💩 <a href="shithead.html">Shithead Card Game</a></h3>
<p>Welcome to the Shithead card game, where your objective is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards;
the last player left with cards is the Shithead. To play, you must place a card of equal or higher value than the top
card on the pile, following a card order from 3 (lowest) to Ace (highest). If you cannot make a legal move, you must
pick up the entire pile. Watch for special cards: a '2' can be played on anything and resets the pile, allowing the
next player to play any card, and a '10', also playable on anything, burns the pile, removing it from the game and
granting you an extra turn. Four of a kind played in a row also burns the pile and gives you another turn. You must play
all cards from your hand first, then your face-up cards, and finally your blind face-down cards to win the game.</p>

<h3>🐍 <a href="snakemono.html">Snake Mono</a></h3>
<p>Welcome to Monochrome Snake. To begin, click the Start Game button. Your objective is to control the snake using either
the [WASD] keys or the [Arrow] keys to move up, down, left, or right. Guide the snake to eat the food blocks that appear
on the board, which will increase your score, your snake's length, and the game's speed. The game ends if you collide with
the edges of the game board or run into your own snake's tail. You can press [P] to pause the game at any time, and if you
get a 'Game Over', press [Enter] to restart and try for a new high score.</p>

<h3>🐍 <a href="snakeneon.html">Snake Neon</a></h3>
<p>In this neon-themed snake game, you control the snake using the Arrow Keys or W, A, S, D to move around the board.
The primary goal is to eat food to grow longer and earn points. Different food items provide different benefits: Apples
grant 10 points and add 1 length, Cherries give 50 points and add 3 length, and Grapes award 100 points and a temporary
speed boost without adding length. As your score increases, you will level up, which makes the snake move faster and adds
new obstacles to the play area. The game ends if you collide with the walls, an obstacle, or your own tail.</p>

level. The goal is to push all the boxes ($) onto designated target squares (.). The rules are simple but create
a deep challenge: you can only push boxes (never pull them), and you can only push one box at aime. You can't push
a box if there's a wall (#) or another box directly behind it. The game is all about spatial reasoning and planning,
as you must figure out the correct sequence of moves to get every box to its destination without getting any of them
stuck in a corner or against a wall where you can no longer move them.</p>

<h3>🟩 <a href="tetrismono.html">Tetris Mono</a></h3>
<p>Welcome to Monochrome Tetris, a retro-styled version of the classic puzzle game where your goal is to arrange falling
blocks (Tetrominos) into complete horizontal lines. When you fill a line, it clears from the screen, and you earn points.
The game's level increases for every ten lines you clear, which also causes the pieces to fall faster. The game ends if
the blocks stack up and reach the top of the playing field. To play, use the [WASD] or [Arrow] keys to move the pieces
left and right, and press [W] or [Arrow Up] to rotate them. You can press [S] or [Arrow Down] to make a piece fall faster
(soft drop), or press the [Space] bar to make it instantly drop to the bottom (hard drop). You can also press [P] to pause
the game at any time.</p>
